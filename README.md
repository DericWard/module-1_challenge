HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description: This repo contains my solution refactoring supplied index.html and style.css files to include semantic HTML. This has included refactoring both the HTML and CSS files to remove any unnecessary duplication and repetition, ensuring the flow of both files follows the final output, swapping non-semantic elements for semantic elements, ensuring all links work, commenting any changes to the CSS file, creating a GitHub repo for the challenge files, pushing the app from my local computer to GitHub, following best practices by pushing to branches, merging the branches to the main branch, publishing the app to GitHub Pages, and writing this README.md.

- The motivation behind this project was to gain familiarity with refactoring HTML and CSS, and gaining more experience with using GitHub.
- This project solved a need for code refactoring of the supplied index.html and style.css files.
- By completing this project I have become more familiar with code refactoring and using GitHub and GitHub Pages, plus the requirements of usable README.md for the repo.
